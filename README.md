<h2>Welcome! 👋</h2>

<p>
  I currently work as a software developer in British Columbia, Canada.
</p>

<h4>Stuff About Me</h4>
<ul>
  <li>👨‍💻 Most of my experience is in Javascript and NodeJS, although I also know C++, a tiny bit of Python, and MySQL</li>
  <li>🍲 Other than programming, I enjoy rhythm games and spicy food</li>
  <li>💙 I love helping people. Never be afraid to ask me something</li>
  <li>🤖 I write and take commissions for Discord bots! If you're ever curious, DM me: SpikeHD#3336</li>
  <li>🖼️ I'm probably most proud of my <a href="https://github.com/SpikeHD/AsciiVert">AsciiVert</a> project</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If ever you're looking for someone to collaborate on a project and think I may be able to help, I'd love to, so don't hesitate to contact me
